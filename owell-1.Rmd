```{r}
wells
```
We have two dataframes withing our Well data, both within 'Saudi' and both involving data on 23 wells. 'metals' contains 21 variables, mainly with data on the average g/L of a particular dissolved metal from groundwater samples. 'chemistry' contains 26 variables, mainly measuring the mg/L physical and chemical parameters of the groundwater samples. Both data frames conclude with the coordinates, altitude, distance to the nearest fault, and geology of the well location.
